                Celebrations in Morocco are deeply rooted in Islamic traditions and Berber heritage. 
                Religious holidays like Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha are the most important celebrations, 
                bringing families together for special meals and prayers.

                National holidays celebrate Morocco's independence and monarchy. These occasions often 
                feature traditional music, dancing, and communal gatherings in public spaces.

                Food plays a central role in all celebrations. Families prepare elaborate meals, 
                and sharing food with neighbors and the less fortunate is considered a blessing. 
                Traditional sweets and mint tea are essential parts of any celebration.
              </p>

                The concept of "baraka" (blessing) is important in Moroccan celebrations. 
                People believe that celebrating together brings good fortune and strengthens 
                community bonds.
