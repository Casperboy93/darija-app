          <strong>Leisure in Morocco:</strong> Football is extremely popular in Morocco, and you'll find people playing 
          in streets and parks everywhere. Traditional music like Chaabi and Gnawa are important cultural elements. 
          Many Moroccans enjoy spending time in caf√©s, playing cards or chess, and socializing with friends and family.
